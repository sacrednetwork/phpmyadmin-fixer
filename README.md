Fixes for phpmyadmin (configuration storage and some extended features)

If you're tired of the message "The phpMyAdmin configuration storage is not completely configured, some extended features have been deactivated", this patch for you ;-)

##What do you get?
- Tracking pages (version control MySQL table structure and data);
- Bookmarks allow you to save predefined queries and execute them later;
- You can show recently used tables in the navigation panel. It helps you jump across the table directly, without the need to select the database and the table;
- Triggers - code which is automatically executed in response to certain events.
- Designer mode (visually display your tables and a graphical way of creating, editing, and displaying phpMyAdmin relations);
- Relation support (allows relationships (similar to foreign keys) using MySQL-native (InnoDB) methods);
- PDF schema (phpMyAdmin can produce PDF schema of your database);
- You can store comments to describe each column for each table. These will then be shown on the “printview”;
- phpMyAdmin can be configured to remember several things, column order, and column visibility from a database table) for browsing tables;
- Since release 3.4.x phpMyAdmin allows users to set most preferences by themselves and store them in the database;
- Since release 4.2.0 you can save and load query-by-example searches from the Database > Query panel;
- Since release 4.5.0 you can save and load export templates;
- no message about "storage is not completely configured";

- changes inside /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php, fixes value;
- makes a backup of /etc/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php in /root folder;
- adds in a mysql pma user / and the table phpmyadmin (if the user "pma" or the table "phpmyadmin" already exists, the script will delete those!);
- download and add table for database phpmyadmin;
